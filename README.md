# What is Whiskers?
Whiskers is an Open Source, visual Dialogue editor made using Godot.

# How do I use this?
We've included a few example projects in `/examples` to get you started! Play around with them to understand what each node does, and how they interact with each-other!

It is ***very*** important that you connect ***all*** dead-end nodes to an `End` node! Or else your dialogue asset won't save properly and it'll run into issues while parsing! This can cause you to ***lose all unsaved progress!***

This project is still being developed, and you *will* encounter bugs! Please be sure to report all issues to this Repository so we can get them fixed ASAP!

# How do I use an exported Dialogue Assets?
A Dialogue Parser plugin for Godot is coming soon:tm:, but feel free to create your own! We've tried to keep exported assets as simple as possible.

We've also created a Parser for the `demo` portion of the tool, so adding that to your project should work OK!

# How can I help?
The best way to help is to use Whiskers and give me your suggestions and feedback! Of course, pull-requests are always welcome!

# Why did you make Whiskers?
There are lots of awesome Dialogue creation tools out there, but I like a good challenge! Creating this tool taught me a *lot* about Godot. Having created my own solution also means that I can add new Features much quicker than if I was using a third-party one!
